# Example Quarkus Application

This is a very basic example application to demonstrate the Health extensions.

## Running the example.

Using maven, you can start this application in dev mode:

    
```
    mvn clean install quarkus:dev
```

You can then go to http://localhost:8080/health-ui/index.html to see the UI and probes
